## Personal projects:

### Australiapp:
I created Australiapp as a simple way to track my expenses while I'm studying abroad. It provides a Node.js/Express REST API and a React frontend. https://github.com/alexmushi/Australiapp

### Adobe OCR Dashboard:
I created this simple app as a proof of concept for the NotarÃ­a project. It didn't make its way to the final version of the app, but it helped me learn to use Adobe's OCR API. https://github.com/alexmushi/pruebaArquitecturaOCR
