**Full-stack developer & cybersecurity enthusiast** from QuerÃ©taro, MÃ©xico. I'm studying Computer Technologies Engineering at ITESM and a Master's in IT (Cyber Security) at Macquarie University. I'm a creative and persistent person with strong leadership skills, able to build solid relationships and communicate effectively in multidisciplinary teams. I enjoy learning on my own initiative and constantly look for ways to grow and add value. Currently, I apply these skills in software development and technology projects, focusing on quality, efficiency, and delivering a great user experience.
